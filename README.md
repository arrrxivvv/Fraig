Logic Circuit Simplifier

This is a program that deals with combinational “And-Inverter-Graphs”. Given an and-inverter-
graph circuit specified in a file in aag format, this program can read in the circuit and construct the 
circuit model. Simulation and simplification/optimization can then be performed on the circuit. 
Simulation output and the simplified/optimized circuit can be written into files specified by the user.
